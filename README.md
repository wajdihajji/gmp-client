## Introduction
The project automates the process of daily-basis vulnerability scanning of thousands of hosts using Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM). It creates and manages a set of GVM objects such as tasks and targets responsible for the scanning.

The idea is inspired from finite-state machine model. The implemented algorithm in this project assigns a state to each object involved in the scanning in a way that it defines what action would be required on that object.
